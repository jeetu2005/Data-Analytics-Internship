Task 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis ( EDA ) & Business Intelligence
This Repository contain the complete working process for Task-2 , Where I Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) , Executed SQL Business Queries , Conducted Multivariate Analysis , Built Static Dashboard Using Walmart Retail Sales Dataset.

The goal of this task was to explore the dataset deeply, identify meaningful business patterns, and translate them into insights for decision-making.
🔧 1️⃣ Data Loading & Preprocessing (Working Process)
✔ Loaded Dataset
Imported Walmart_Sales.csv into Python
Used Pandas for initial data inspection
✔ Date Conversion
Converted the Date column from DD-MM-YYYY using pd.to_datetime()
Extracted Month, Year, and Week for time-series analysis
✔ Data Checks
Checked for missing values
Verified datatypes
Ensured numeric columns were correctly interpreted
Prepared the dataset for EDA & SQL processing
📊 2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✔ Univariate Analysis
Summary statistics
Distribution plots for Weekly Sales
Store count and basic patterns
✔ Time-Based Analysis
Monthly sales trends
Weekly movement patterns
Seasonal peaks
✔ Store-Level Performance
Identified top & bottom performing stores
Compared total sales across all 45 stores
🔍 3️⃣ Multivariate Analysis
Using Seaborn & Matplotlib, I explored relationships between multiple variables:

🔥 Visuals Created
Heatmap: Correlations between Temperature, Fuel Price, CPI, Unemployment, and Weekly Sales
Scatter Plots:
Temperature vs Weekly Sales
Fuel Price vs Weekly Sales
CPI vs Weekly Sales
Unemployment vs Weekly Sales
Boxplot: Holiday vs Non-Holiday Sales
🔥 Key Findings
Holiday weeks showed significantly higher median sales
Temperature influenced shopping behavior (moderate weather = more sales)
Fuel Price, CPI, and Unemployment had weaker correlations
Store performance had the strongest influence on weekly sales
🧮 4️⃣ SQL Business Questions (Executed Using SQLite in Python)
I integrated SQL inside Python using SQLite and answered 7 key business questions:

✔ Queries Answered
Total sales by store
Highest monthly average sales
Holiday vs Non-Holiday performance
Top 10 revenue-generating weeks
Fuel price impact on sales
Yearly sales summary
CPI impact on average weekly sales
✔ Purpose
Combining SQL + Python helped cross-verify insights and simulate real analytics workflow.

📈 5️⃣ Static BI Dashboard Mockup
Designed a dashboard containing:

⭐ KPI Cards
Total Sales
Avg Weekly Sales
Best Performing Store
Best Month
Holiday Week Revenue Increase
⭐ Visuals
Weekly Sales Trend Line Chart
Total Sales by Store Bar Chart

📝 6️⃣ Key Insights (Summary)
Store 20 consistently leads in overall sales
March shows the highest monthly average sales
Holiday weeks boost sales by a large margin
Moderate temperature correlates with higher sales
External economic factors impact sales less than store performance
Strong seasonal patterns exist in weekly sales
